                    <h3>Charlie's New Deal</h3>
                    <p>Center fielder Charlie Blackmon's dedication to his craft has allowed him to improve his game as the years advance. That trait was one of the reasons the Rockies signed him Wednesday to a six-year contract, including two player options, which could keep him in purple pinstripes through the 2023 season. According to Major League sources, the deal is worth $108 million for six years, but incentives could improve his earnings over that time to $116 million.</p>

                    <h3>Blackmon's Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>"I'm very proud," said Blackmon, an All-Star Game participant in 2014 and last season. "It's really hard to play in the big leagues. It's very hard. For that reason, I think there are a lot of very talented guys that struggle to get the at-bats or the playing time that they need to reach their potential. "I've been thankful enough to have those at-bats and be able to play enough baseball and keep getting better, and learning more about my body and how to play the game is important. That's part of what drives me."</p>
